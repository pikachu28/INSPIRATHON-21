Develop a product where online trolling and harassment can be controlled as well as there is a feature to collect information about trollers and report them accordingly. Your tool should be able to identify bots and trolls. You can also add a feature to carry out historical analysis and predictive analysis based on existing tweets or posts to identify potential trollers and report them if needed. The system should also ensure data privacy and implement complete anonymity if and when required.
